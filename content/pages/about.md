title: About 
date: 2020-07-05

I am Mila, a software engineer based in Turku, Finland. I mostly work with Python, but also specialize in embedded systems.
Outside of work I like to fiddle with my Raspberry Pi and organize meetups for a tech community for women and non-binaries here in Turku with my friend. 
I am an avid reader and traveller. In my spare time you can find me at the pool or at an occasional yoga session.
